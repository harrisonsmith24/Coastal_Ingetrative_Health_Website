				<h2>Laser Therapy</h2> 
					<p>Laser therapy is a fast, painless, and safe treatment for a wide range 
					of conditions. Each treatment typically takes from 5 to 10 minutes, with most
					patients seeing results after around 3 to 5 sessions. <br>
					It works by utilizing your body’s own natural healing powers, stimulating 
					cellular activity to reduce inflammation and induce the recovery process. Even 
					though laser therapy sessions are quick, the healing properties it provides you 
					to continue for up to 24 hours afterward. <br> 
					One of its primary benefits is the fact it helps reduce inflammation and pain 
					without any nasty side effects. Because it involves a process called photobiomodulation, 
					whereby cellular metabolism is increased, it doesn’t create any unwanted after-effects
					like other types of medications. Furthermore, many patients report long-lasting pain relief,
					with some only requiring several treatments to feel these benefits.</p>

				<h2>Chiropractic Care</h2>
				<p>Your spine is what protects your spinal cord. Your spinal cord is how your body 
				   communicates between the brain and every system. If there is a vertebra that is misaligned,
				   it may be impinging on a nerve. This is important because it is being found that the 
				   nervous system plays a key role in how your immune system functions. Therefore, 
				   if your nervous system is being compromised, your immune system may be 
				   compromised and malfunctioning. A chiropractor is a specially trained 
				   doctor that treats and protects the nervous system by relieving pressure 
				   off of the nerves. By doing this, you are allowing your body to function at its max 
				   potential and not overreact to allergens, fight infections quicker as well as 
				   decrease to likelihood of contracting illness such as colds and flus.</p>

				<h2>Physical Therapy</h2> 
					<p>Through a thorough medical history and physical evaluation, we will 
						examine the areas that you are having pain or limitations and also identify 
						areas that may be at risk for future injury. We will help identify what 
						physical restrictions may be contributing to pain in the affected area as well as
						resultant swing faults that may be present.<br>
						<br>
						For example, a patient presenting with medial elbow pain or golfers elbow will 
						have a thorough common elbow evaluation. After this, we will examine the surrounding 
						wrist and shoulder to evaluate for physical restrictions. A right-handed golfer who has 
						restrictions in their R shoulder for flexion and external rotation will have difficulty 
						achieving their full backswing, thus straining the medial elbow. Additionally, 
						restrictions in other areas such as the thoracic spine or R hip for internal rotation 
						may be present but not obvious and need to be addressed to assure optimal outcomes 
						with a return to sport.</p>

				<h2>Massage Therapy</h2>
				<p>Massage therapy is a healing practice which can enhance an individual’s 
					wellness and physiological performance. A massage can have a positive 
					impact on the physique and psyche of a person. A shortlist of the amazing 
					effects a massage can have include: shuttling toxins away from soft tissues,
					improving blood flow, and improving the resilience of the body’s many 
					fibers and joints.<br>
					<br>
					Massage therapy has also been known to assist in treating muscle spasms and 
					muscle trauma. The reason this is the case is that a massage reduces the amount 
					of time it takes to recover by improving the flow of the circulatory system. 
					This, in turn, allows the body to recover faster naturally.</p>

				<h2>Spinal Decompression</h2>
				<p>The main region of the body that a spinal decompression table works 
					on would be the neck (cervical) or the low back region (lumbar). Spinal 
					decompression will be done with either the lumbar unit or the cervical unit, 
					they are not performed at the same time. Non-Surgical Spinal Decompression 
					is very effective at treating bulging discs, herniated discs, pinched nerves, 
					sciatica, radiating arm pain, degenerative disc disease, leg pain, facet 
					yndromes, hypomobility, and compression fractures. This treatment option is 
					very safe and utilizes FDA cleared equipment to apply distraction forces to 
					spinal structures in a precise and graduated manner. Distraction is offset by 
					cycles of partial relaxation. There are 4 protocols that will be used with different
					time intervals and weighted pulls set up, depending on what part of your treatment 
					plan you are on. This technique of spinal decompression therapy, that is, unloading 
					due to distraction and positioning, has shown the ability to gently separate the 
					vertebrae from each other, creating a vacuum inside the discs that we are targeting. 
					This “vacuum effect” is also known as negative intra-discal pressure.</p>
